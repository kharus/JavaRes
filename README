Introduction

This code implements simple, resolution-based theorem provers for
first-order logic. It is released as free software under the GNU GPL
version 3, and without any warranty. See the file COPYING for
details and the individual source headers for copyright information.

This code is largely a translation of https://github.com/eprover/PyRes , created by Prof.
Stephan Schulz, from Python into Java, with some additions to support SUMO

Directories

src - source code
test - jUnit tests
StarExec - files required to run under StarExec
papers - CADE2021 submission
lib - Java libraries
dist - zip file of JavaRes used in tests reported in CADE2021 submission
data - results from testing on StarExec with TPTP

Compiling

Install ant and just type

ant

while in the top level of the git repository.  To compile a zip for StarExec, type

ant star


jUnit Tests

paths are relative to where you've cloned the repository, and given the environment
variable $GITDIR.  UnitTestAll runs all unit tests.  ProverTest is an integration
test on TPTP problems.  It requires that the environment variable $TPTP be set
to the location of the TPTP problems. The only external libraries needed are for
jUnit (and its supporting hamcrest library, which are in the lib dir)

java -Xmx7G -cp $GITDIR/JavaRes/build/classes:$GITDIR/JavaRes/lib/*
  org.junit.runner.JUnitCore atp.UnitTestAll

java -Xmx7G -cp $GITDIR/JavaRes/build/classes:$GITDIR/JavaRes/lib/*
  org.junit.runner.JUnitCore atp.ProverTest


Running JavaRes

To run on a TPTP problem -

java -Xmx15G -cp $GITDIR/JavaRes/build/classes:$GITDIR/JavaRes/lib/*
  atp.Prover2 --eqax --proof --delete-tautologies --forward-subsumption
  --backward_subsumption --delete-tautologies --timeout 600 -v $TPTP/Problems/PUZ/PUZ001+1.p

To get help that shows the list of availabe command line options -

  java -Xmx15G -cp $GITDIR/JavaRes/build/classes:$GITDIR/JavaRes/lib/*
    atp.Prover2 -h
